* Introduction

This repository contains our group's Quantum Programming project. This project
performs a k-Nearest-Neighbours (kNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset in three different
ways using a classical algorithm, a quantum algorithm simulation and an actual IBM quantum computer running the algorithm. 

Based on the results, we try to examine the differences the difference in performance between the tree algorithms.

The code for hybrid algorithm is based on the code written by Daniel Kok, which can be found here: https://github.com/GroenteLepel/qiskit-quantum-knn
The circuit run on IBM is based on the circuit build in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10453
