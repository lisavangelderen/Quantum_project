* Introduction

This repository contains our group's Quantum Programming project. This project
performs a k-Nearest-Neighbours (kNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset in three different
ways using a classical algorithm, a quantum algorithm simulation and an actual IBM quantum computer running the algorithm. 

Based on the results, we examine the differences in running time, coding
complexity, and noise between these three kNN algorithms.
