* Introduction

In this repository you will find our quantum programming project. Our project
takes the Iris dataset and performs a KNN algorithm on it in three different
ways. The first algorithm will be a classical one. The second will be a quantum
computer simulation and the third an IBM quantum computer. 

Based on the results, we will look at the difference in running time, coding
complexity, and noise.
